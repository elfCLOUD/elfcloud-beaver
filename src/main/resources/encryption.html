    <h1>Data encryption</h1>
    <p>elfcloud.fi Beaver will automatically encrypt all sent data with the selected encryption key. This topic will guide you on adding and selecting encryption keys.</p>

    <a name="keyadd"><h2>Adding a new encryption key</h2></a>
    <p>Encryption keys can be added from the elfcloud.fi Beaver key manager tool <img src="icons/key16.png"/>. You can add multiple keys for different purposes (see Fig. 1).</p>

    <p>An encryption key can be added by clicking the Add-buttom from bottom of the key manager window (see Fig. 1). Generate a new key -option (see Fig. 2) allows you to generate a new key.
    You can give a description for the key, which will help you to identify keys from others. There are three (3) different modes available: AES128, AES192 and AES256. AES256 provides
    the strongest encryption but it may not available on all platforms.</p>

    <a name="keyload"><h2>Loading an encryption key from a file</h2></a>
    <p>An encryption key can be loaded from a file using the Load a key from file -option (see Fig. 2). You need to select the file containing the encryption key and give a description for it.
    elfcloud.fi Beaver adds all the loaded keys to the default key folder by default. This folder is located in user's home folder.</p>
    
    <a name="keyselect"><h2>Selecting an encryption key</h2></a>
    <p>You can select the encryption key you want to use when storing data by selecting it from the list (see Fig. 1). Encryption key will become active when Select-button is pressed.</p>
    <p>In order to download encrypted files, you don't have to select the correct key by yourself. elfcloud.fi Beaver automatically selects the correct key from the available keys list (see Fig. 1) and 
    uses it to decrypt the data. If you don't have the correct key available, elfcloud.fi Beaver will prompt you with information dialog.</p>
